            <!-- This is a paragraph explaining the endangerment of orangutans -->
            
            <p>Nearly 150,000 Bornean orangutans have disappeared since 1999. More than 60% of the natural orangutan habitat has been destroyed. Extinction is highly likely in the next 10 years for Sumatran orangutans and Bornean orangutans. Both species are classified as Critically Endangered according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.</p>

            <h2>What is an Orangutan?</h2>
            
            <!-- This is a paragraph on what orangutans are-->
            <P>Orangutans are great apes, as opposed to monkeys. They are very closely related to humans, having 97% of DNA in common. They are extremely patient and intelligent mammals. They are very observant and inquisitive. There are many stories of orangutans escaping from zoos after having watched their keepers unlock and lock doors. They are also very strong, allowing them to swing from branch to branch and hang upside-down from branches to achieve fruit and eat young leaves.</P>

            <h2>Why are they endangered?</h2>
            
            <!-- This is a paragraph on why the orangutans are endangered -->
            
            <p>     One of the leading causes of endangerment for oragutans is Palm Oil Plantations. Palm Oil Plantations are s leading supplier for a global market that uses tree's versatile oil for cooking, cosmetics, and biofuel.  The need for palm oil comes with a significant costs. Palm oil plantations often replace tropical forests, killing endangered species, uprooting local communities, and contributing to the release of climate-warming gases. The orangutans that are displaced starve to death, are killed by plantation workers as pests, or die in the fires. 
            <br /> <br /> 
            Logging is another vital reason that the orangutans are endangered, especially those who spend their lives in trees. Another factor, such as fires, poses as a threat to orangutans. This is because the smoke confuses them leaving them vulnerable to death from loss of habitat and food. Fires are commonly started to clear the land and undergrowth for farming and palm oil plantations.</p>
